# SingletonPattern
The project implements the Singleton pattern to manage a single instance of the MortgageFacade class. It ensures efficient mortgage approval processing by verifying a user's bank balance, outstanding loans, and credit rating. Using a private constructor and static instance, the pattern ensures global access to the MortgageFacade instance.
